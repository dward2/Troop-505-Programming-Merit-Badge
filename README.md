2.  Log in or create an account.  If you cannot make an account, visit https://onlinegdb.com/S1OMnstuO instead.  You will then need to make a copy (or "fork") that code in order to edit your own.
3.  Make the following changes to the code:
  - Allow the user to type "Q" in the main room to quit the program.  The statement to end the program is `System.Environment.Exit(0);`.
